1. (a) Around 1.5 hours, since at first I try to get all data from all pages,but double confirm with my recruiter. I print out the first page like example does
   (b) I definitely will add paginator to allow display all the data. Maybe also some filter functions which allow user easily to search, and download function can used to download result into .csv file.
2. So the latest version of React is adding the React.memo() and React.lazy()
3. So for the performance issue usually feedback on the backend or frontend. for the backend I usually track by using print(variable) to see which step is wrong, for the front I can use console.log to display
    those data passing through function. Always work for me. Also I will google it or stackflow if it is out of my knowledge
4. 1.build user-friendly interface for API, 2. build url path. 3.I can also build a login interface for user login to use API.
    4.I can save user information in backend, I also can set permission rank for different user to control their action.
